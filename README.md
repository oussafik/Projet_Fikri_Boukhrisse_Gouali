Dermatological Classification Project
Overview
Dermatological conditions impact a substantial portion of the global population, posing diagnostic challenges due to intricate visual cues such as skin texture complexities, lesion locations, and the presence of hair. With over 1500 identified skin disorders significantly affecting the quality of life, accurate diagnosis is paramount. This project presents an innovative approach utilizing pixel-level data from a comprehensive dataset. Three distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are employed to analyze the pixel data.

Models and Accuracies
Model 1 CNN1 : Achieves a commendable accuracy of 98%.
Model 2 & Model 3 : Impresses with an accuracy of 97%.

Ensemble Strategy
To further enhance diagnostic accuracy, a voting mechanism is implemented to consolidate predictions from these models. The ensemble strategy outperforms individual models, achieving an overall high accuracy.
